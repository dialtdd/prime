# Prime

## About

The **prime** program generates a table of prime numbers, writing a paginated
report to the standard output. Twin primes (a prime that is either 2 less or
2 greater than another prime) are designated with an asterisk suffix after the
number.

The file **prime.xls** lists how the program has performed on a multitude of
different hardwar platform and operating system configurations.
